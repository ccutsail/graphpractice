The files in this repository were written by Cory Cutsail, 2016. 

Two csv files contain voting data from the United States Senate on bills voted on in June 2016.

Original data for votedata.csv can be found here: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2016/s106
It has been cleaned, so that each senator is associated a code containing R if republican, D if democrat, I if independent.
The senators are ordered as they are in the original csv file.


Original data for the other .csv file is here: https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2016/s104
It has been cleaned in the same way, with the codes for senators identical to the codes in the previous dataset to ensure consistency.

Sagegraph.ipynb is hosted as a Jupyter notebook, but should be hosted as a Sage worksheet. Sage's terminal is unintuitive, and I don't have the desktop application. Copy and paste the contents to a Sage worksheet, and ensure that the voting data is in the same directory/folder on SageMathCloud. It should then compile properly. 

The TTCvis file is a visualization of the top trading cycle algorithm posted on my blog on July 4, 2016 under the title "Week in Review Part 4 Part 2"
